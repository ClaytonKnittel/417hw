function [train_err, test_err] = AdaBoost(X_tr, y_tr, X_te, y_te, numTrees)
% AdaBoost: Implement AdaBoost with decision stumps as the weak learners. 
%           (hint: read the "Name-Value Pair Arguments" part of the "fitctree" documentation)
%   Inputs:
%           X_tr: Training data
%           y_tr: Training labels
%           X_te: Testing data
%           y_te: Testing labels
%           numTrees: The number of trees to use
%  Outputs: 
%           train_err: Classification error of the learned ensemble on the training data
%           test_err: Classification error of the learned ensemble on test data

% You may use "fitctree" but not any inbuilt boosting function
